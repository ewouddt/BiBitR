Description: A simple R wrapper for the Java BiBit algorithm from "A
    biclustering algorithm for extracting bit-patterns from binary datasets"
    from Domingo et al. (2011) <DOI:10.1093/bioinformatics/btr464>. An adaption for the BiBit algorithm which allows noise in the biclusters as well as a workflow to guide the algorithm towards given patterns are also included.
